## react-Native version support ( >= 0.59 )

- This library only supports RN > 0.58 and above due to react-native/TextInput.onSelectionChange function support. Check the example [here](https://github.com/mrazadar/react-native-mentions-editor/example/index.js)

- `SuggestionsDataSource` prop is renamed to `suggestionsData`. This now accepts an array of objects. DataSource, No more!

- `SuggestionsPanelHeight` prop is renamed to `suggestionRowHeight` in order to support vertical lists.
